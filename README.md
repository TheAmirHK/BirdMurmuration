# Bird murmuration behaviour
Murmuration happens when large groups of birds, usually starlings, fly together in coordinated patterns, creating mesmerizing, fluid shapes in the sky. The movement looks almost like a living wave or a shifting cloud.
Thousands of starlings create mesmerizing aerial formations *without a leader*, adjusting based on their nearest neighbors.
Each bird follows simple rules (stay close but not too close, align with others), forming self-organizing patterns.
